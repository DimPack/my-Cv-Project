    "description": "I am passionate about web development and have been honing my skills in this field for several years. In 2021, I worked as a front-end developer at a small company. Unfortunately, my career was interrupted by the full-scale war in Ukraine. During that time, I voluntarily joined the military. In 2023, I was injured and subsequently discharged from military service. After returning to civilian life, I refocused on web development, continuing to deepen my knowledge and actively seek new opportunities for professional growth."
