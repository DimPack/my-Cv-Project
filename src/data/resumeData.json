    "description": "I am passionate about web development and have been improving my skills in this area for many years. In 2021, I worked for a small company for 7 months, working in a front-end position. Unfortunately, my career path was interrupted due to the largescale war in Ukraine that started in 2022. At that time, I volunteered for military service and served for six months until I was demobilized due to a serious injury. After returning to civilian life, I focused on web development again, continuing to expand my knowledge and look for new opportunities for professional growth."
