# My CV Project

This is a personal resume (CV) website built with React.  
The project features a modern, responsive design and is structured using reusable components for each section (Contacts, Experience, Education, Skills, About Me, Languages, etc.).  
All content is managed via a JSON file, making it easy to update information without changing the code.

**Main features:**
- Responsive layout with sidebar and main content
- Skills section with animated marquee icons
- Data-driven: all resume content comes from a single JSON file
- Easy to customize and extend

## Getting Started

   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Project Structure
